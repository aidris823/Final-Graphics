1. Phong Shading
2. Gouraud Shading
3. Shapes besides the ones we made (Pyramid, cyllinder)

Animation kind of doesn't work on my laptop currently (I'm looking into why), so I probably can't do anything funny with vary, unfortunately.

I was trying pyramid, but I seem to be repeatedly getting errors when with LexToken...
